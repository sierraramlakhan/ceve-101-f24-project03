### Discussion
The dataset encompasses all years associated with notable drought occurrences in Cariré, Brazil. This comprehensive coverage is essential for ensuring the reliability and robustness of the analysis, as it allows the model to effectively capture the effects of these extreme events on water availability. By incorporating data from the drought years, the analysis can precisely evaluate system performance during stressful periods, yielding valuable insights into the sufficiency of water storage solutions and the potential risks of future water scarcity.

Moreover, the inclusion of drought years significantly bolsters the validity of the reliability assessment and enhances confidence in the findings, given that extreme conditions are often the most difficult and critical to model accurately.

The dataset includes all years corresponding to significant drought events in Cariré, Brazil. This completeness is critical for the reliability and robustness of the analysis, as it ensures that the model captures the impact of these extreme events on water availability. With data from the drought years available, the analysis can accurately assess system performance during periods of stress, providing meaningful insights into the adequacy of water storage solutions and the potential for future water scarcity risks. Furthermore, the inclusion of drought years enhances the validity of the reliability assessment and strengthens confidence in the results, as extreme conditions are often the most challenging and critical to model accurately.

HHistorical data reveal that Cariré, situated in Ceará, Brazil, has faced significant droughts, particularly in 1993, 1998, and 2012. These droughts are part of a larger trend impacting Northeast Brazil, frequently associated with El Niño events, which result in below-average rainfall and severe water shortages.

Incorporating data from these drought years into the analysis is vital for accurately evaluating water resource management and system resilience under extreme conditions. Conversely, the absence of data from these periods could impede the evaluation process.


## Limiting Assumptions 

1. **Constant Runoff Coefficient (η):**
   Assumes a fixed value, ignoring variations due to rainfall intensity and/or roof conditions.

2. **Uniform Consumption (Ct):**
   Models consumption as zero during the rainy season and constant during the dry season, ignoring daily or seasonal variability.

3. **No Losses Considered:**
   Neglects evaporation and leakage, overestimating water availability.

4. **Sole Reliance on Precipitation:**
   Assumes rainfall as the only input, limiting applicability to integrated systems.


## Proposed Model Modifications based on Assumptions
1. **Variable Runoff Coefficient:**
   Use a dynamic coefficient based on rainfall intensity:
$$
       η(P_t) = η_0 + α * P_t
$$

2. **Dynamic Consumption Rates:**
   Account for seasonal and household variations:
$$
       C_t = C_0 * f(t)
$$

3. **Incorporating Losses:**
   Add evaporation (E_t) and leakage (L_t) to the mass balance equation:
   $$
       V_t+1 = V_t + Q_t - C_t - E_t - L_t
$$
4. **Rainfall Variability:**
   Model P_t using probabilistic distributions to capture extreme events.
$$
       P_t ~ Normal(μ, σ^2)
$$

These adjustments can improve the model's accuracy and applicability for real-world scenarios.

## Model Implementation and Testing

### Running Simulation for One Year
```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
param = ModelParameters(          # <1>
    runoff_coefficient=0.85,      # <2>
    roof_area_m2=45.0,            # <3>
    first_flush_mm=2.0,           # <4>
    tank_capacity_L=16000.0       # <5>
)
```


Using the year 1981: 

```{julia}
#| echo: false
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]    # <1>
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param) # <2>
p1 = plot(results_1981)                                 # <3>
```

Comparing rainfall and tank volume:

```{julia}
#| echo: false
p2 = plot(rainfall_1981)
plot(p2, p1, layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)
```
The graph demonstrates how the tank volume increases in response to rainfall events, with rapid rises expected to correspond to heavy rainfall. The tank reaches full capacity around periods of intense precipitation, reflecting efficient water collection. Notably, there are no periods where the tank runs dry, indicating sufficient rainfall and tank capacity to meet storage needs. However, overflow could therefore occur if rainfall exceeds the tank's maximum capacity, suggesting the need for adjustments during these extreme weather cases.


### Reliability Analysis

# Modifying Model Parameters
To improve the system's performance during dry seasons, the roof area and tank capacity is adjusted. 
These changes directly affect the collection and storage of water, enhancing the system's reliability.

```{julia}
#| echo: false
# Defining updated parameters
param_updated = ModelParameters(
    runoff_coefficient=0.85,  
    #Retaining the original value
    roof_area_m2=70.0,        #Increased to improve water collection
    first_flush_mm=2.0,       
    #Retain the original value
    tank_capacity_L=25000.0   # Increased from 16,000 L to hold more water
)
```

# Simulating for the year 1981 with updated parameters
```{julia}
#| echo: false
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]  # Select annual rainfall data for 1981
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param_updated)  

plot_1981 = plot(results_1981)  


rainfall_plot = plot(rainfall_1981)
plot(rainfall_plot, plot_1981, layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)

#| fig-cap: "Tank Volume Response and Rainfall Comparison for 1981"
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]  # Select annual rainfall data for 1981
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param_updated)  # Run the simulation
plot_combined = plot(plot(rainfall_1981), plot(results_1981), layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)
plot_combined

```
To enhance the system's performance during dry seasons, the following updated parameters were defined and some kept:

Runoff Coefficient (0.85):
Retained the original value, representing the proportion of rainfall that contributes to water collection.

Roof Area (70.0 m²):
Increased from the original 45.0 m² to improve water collection by capturing more rainfall.

First Flush (2.0 mm):
Retained the original value, accounting for the initial rainfall volume discarded due to impurities.

Tank Capacity (25,000 L):
Increased from 16,000 L to store more water, ensuring sufficient supply during extended dry periods.

# Justification of Parameter Adjustments
1. **Roof Area:**
   Increased to 70 m² to improve water collection capacity, ensuring more rainwater is captured during rainfall events.

2. **Tank Capacity:**
   Increased to 25,000 L to store additional water for longer dry periods, reducing the likelihood of shortages.

# Performing Reliability Analysis for All Years

Why? - Reliability analysis helps to evaluate whether the adjusted system parameters are adequate to meet the water demand across all available years.

# Running the Simulation for All Years
```{julia}
#| echo: false
# Running the simulation for all years
all_years = sort(collect(keys(rainfall_data.annual_data)))  # Get all years
all_results = [run_timesteps(rainfall_data.annual_data[year], param_updated) for year in all_years]  # Run simulation for each year
any_failures = [!isempty(result.failure_dates) for result in all_results]  # Check if failures occurred

#| echo: true
println("Number of years with failures: ", sum(any_failures), " out of ", length(all_years))  # Print results
```

# Discussion and Interpretation of Findings

The reliability analysis reveals that the system performed well, meeting demand for most years with the updated parameters. 
Out of 50 years, 3 years experienced failures, resulting in a reliability of 6%.

This indicates that increasing the roof area and tank capacity significantly reduces the risk of water shortages.
However, the system is still vulnerable to extended dry periods or severe droughts, highlighting the need for further improvements, 
such as incorporating dynamic runoff coefficients or accounting for water losses due to evaporation and leakage.

## Identifying Gaps in the Methods

## Limitation:
The model assumes a constant runoff coefficient and neglects losses such as evaporation and leakage, which may overestimate available water.

## Proposed Solution:
Incorporate evaporation and leakage as additional loss terms in the mass balance equation:
$$
    V_t+1 = V_t + Q_t - C_t - E_t - L_t
$$ 
where:

- $E_t$ accounts for evaporation (based on temperature and tank area).

- $L_t$ models leakage as a percentage of tank volume.
 
This enhancement would improve the model's accuracy in predicting water availability under realistic conditions.
